 When are functions used in R?
 
 Quite literally all the time :) 
 
when we read a csv, we are using a function, `read_csv()` from the package `readr`.

we typically use 
```
library(readr)
```
to load a package, 

but we can even load just one function from a package with this syntax:
```{r}
heros <- readr::read_csv("super_data/heroes_information.csv")
heros
```
 
 
```{r}
calc_count_by_eyecolor <- function(color){
  count <- sum(heros$`Eye color`==color)
  return(count)
}

calc_count_by_eyecolor("yellow")
```

```{r}
calc_avg_height_by_align <- function(align){
  align_df <- heros[heros$Alignment == align, ]
  count <- mean(align_df$Height)
  return(count)
}

calc_avg_height_by_align("good")
```
```
