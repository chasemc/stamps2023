Working individually or in groups, please reconstruct the original text for the handouts I've given you. You may use the computer as you wish, but I suggest you avoid any attempts at programming...

You have 30 minutes.

Specific questions:

* what techniques or tactics are you using?
* suppose you had to do this with lots more data; how would you do it?
* suppose you were given an unlimited supply of undergraduates; what would you tell them to do and how would you split the work up?
* what advantages do you have in this exercise (English) over DNA?
* what are the pluses and minuses of the two different datatypes?
* Does the order or organization of reads matter?
* if you get to use a reference, how do you know itâ€™s the right reference?
    * (and what strategies might you use to validate your assembly?)
* what strategy would you use if I told you you could employ as many undergrads as you wanted to do this?
